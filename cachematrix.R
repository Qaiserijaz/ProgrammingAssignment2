## MakeCacheMatrix will store the inverse of a matrix as an object, when this value
## is required again, cacheSolve can be called to check if the value is cached and
## returns it.


## MakeCacheMatrix is a function which creates a special matrix that can cache
## it's inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

  m <- NULL
  set <- function (y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
}
get <- function() x
set_inv <- function (inverse) m <<- inverse
get_inv <- function () m
list(set=set,
     get=get,
     set_inv=set_inv,
     get_inv=get_inv)
}

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the 
## matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from 
## the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$get_inv()
  if (!is.null(m)) {
    message("Getting Data From Cache")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data,...)
  x$set_inv(m)
  m
}
